= GNU Make Gradle Plugin

Provides a wrapper for calling GNU Make from Gradle. This is especially useful
for projects migrating to Gradle or when constructing complex build systems of which
some components utilise GNU make as it build tool. Most common command-line switches
are supported, but for full flexibiliy it is possible to add any additional switch via 
the *switches* property.

== Adding the plugin

[source,groovy]
----
buildscript {
  repositories {
      maven {
          url "https://plugins.gradle.org/m2/"
      }
  }
  dependencies {
    classpath 'org.ysb33r.gradle:gnumake:1.0'
  }
}

apply plugin : 'org.ysb33r.gnumake'
----

or if you use Gradle 2.1+

[source,groovy]
----
plugins {
  id 'org.ysb33r.gnumake' version '1.0'
}
----

== Global configuration

With the release of 1.0 there is a project extension `gnumake`, which allows defaults to be set
for all `GnuMakeBuild` tasks

[source,groovy]
----
gnumake {

  executable '/path/to/make' // <1>
  makefile 'Makefile' // <2>
  execArgs '--server', 'server.com', '/opt/pi/make' // <3>
  defaultFlags BUILD_NUMBER : System.getenv('BUILD_NUMBER') // <4>

}
----
<1> Set the path to the make executable. By default is is 'make' for all platforms,
  except Solaris and FreeBSD where it is 'gmake
<2> The makefile to look for. By default it is unset, which means make will look for
  GNUmakefile, makefile, and Makefile in that order.
<3> Arguments that will be added to make invocations.
  These arguments added to the front of the GnuMakeBuild tasks arguments
  i.e. directly following the executable when run. This is the recommended
  approach when running some kind of environment preparation i.e running
  another tool which will invoke make
<4> Make flags that will be added to all GnuMakeBuild tasks,
  (unless a task sets defaultFlags = false)

== The make task

As from 1.0 a default task by names of `make` has been added. Additional tasks can still be added
by doing

[source,groovy]
----
import org.ysb33r.gradle.gnumake.GnuMakeBuild

task runMake (type:GnuMakeBuild) {

  targets 'build','install'
  flags  DESTDIR : '/copy/files/here', BUILD_NUMBER : '12345'

}
----

== Task configuration

A large number of configuration attributes are available. Some are pure prooperties which can
only be set by assignment.

[source,groovy]
----
make {

  alwaysMake = false // <1>
  environmentOverrides = false // <2>
  ignoreErrors = false // <3>
  keepGoing = false // <4>
  jobs = 1 // <5>
  noDefaultFlags = false // <6>
  noExecArgs = false // <7>

}
----
<1> Equivalent of `-B`
<2> Equivalent of `-e`
<3> Equivalent of `-i`
<4> Equivalent of `-k`
<5> Equivalent of `-j`
<6> Determine inheritance of `gnumake.defaultFlags`.
<7> Determine inheritance of `gnumake.execArgs`

Others can be set by a more declaritive style, but can be reset if necessary if need be. It is
recommended to use the declaritive style as it makes for easy appending of entities and will
also lead to a more readable style.

[source,groovy]
----
make {

  makefile 'Makefile' // <1>
  executable '/path/to/make' // <2>
  chDir '/change/to/here' // <3>
  workingDir '/change/here/before/running/make' // <4>
  includeDirs 'dir1', 'dir2' // <5>
  flags DESTDIR : '/copy/files/here', BUILD_NUMBER : '12345' // <6>
  switches '--foo', '--bar' // <7>

}
----
<1> Makefile to use. Equivalent of '-f'. If not set will try to read a default from
  `gnumake.makefile`. Will be converted to a `String` at point of task execution.
<2> Override whatever is defined in `gnumake.executable`.
<3> Change to this directory before processing starts. Equivalent of `-C`. Will be
  evaluated with `project.file` at point of task execution.
<4> Directory to change to before the make command is run. Do not confuse it with
  `chDir`. This is a seldom used option, but should you need it, you'll be glad it is there.
  The default is to start form `project.projectDir`.
<5> Search path for make include files. Equivalent of `-I`. Can be called more
 than once to add more search paths. Will be evaluated with `project.files` at
 point of task execution.
<6> Makes flags. Equivalant of passing `X=Y` on the command-line. Can be
  called more than once to add more build flags.
<7> Pass arbitrary switches to the make executable. This allows for the flexibility
 in the extreme case where none of the current attributes addresses the context
 in which a make build might be called. it is recommended that this option only be
 used if a switch is needed which is not otherwise available. `switches` can be called
 more than once to append more switches.
<8> Targets in the makefile that needs to be executed. This can be null which means the
  default target as deifned in the makefile will be executed. Can be called more than once
  to add more targets.


Two more options exist which helps to determine up to date status. As there is no trivial
way for Gradle to query Make regarding input sources and output artifacts, the best source
of knowledge is the build script author. This person can configure a set of input files or
directories to monitor in order to determine whether the `GnuMakeBuild` task is up to date.
In a similar fashion output directories and files can be added.

[source,groovy]
----
make {
  makeInputs { // <1>
    dir 'dir1'
    file 'single.file.to.check'
    files 'file1','file2'
  }
  makeOutputs { // <2>
    dir 'dir1'
    file 'single.file.to.check'
    files 'file1','file2'
  }
}
----
<1> `makeInputs` has three methods, each of which can be called multiple times. The methods are
  evaluated as per Gradle `TaskInputs`.
<2> `makeOutputs` has three methods, each of which can be called multiple times. The methods are
      evaluated as per Gradle `TaskOutputs`.

== Deprecated Properties

A number of properties from earlier releases have been deprecated.

[cols="2*"]
|===
| `dir` | Use `chDir` instead
| `tasks` | Use `targets` instead
| `buildFile` | Use `makefile` instead
|===

== Rules

With the release of 1.0 the ability to run a make invocation for a specified target
has also been added. Internally the properties for the task will be taken from the defined
task in the build script with the exception of `makeInputs`, `makeOutputs` and `targets`.
Thus the  task `makeClean` will track the properties of the `make` task, but when executed will
only attempt to run the `clean` target.

This is best explained by an example. Consider the following configuration:

[source,groovy]
----
make {
  makefile 'MyMakefile'
  chDir 'legacyBuild'
  targets 'build', 'install'
}
----

If this is run, then the effective executed command-line is

[source,bash]
----
make -C legacyBuild -f MyMakefile build install
----

However by means of a rule it is possible to execute a task called `makeClean` for
which the effective executed command-line is

[source,bash]
----
make -C legacyBuild -f MyMakefile clean
----

It is as simple as that. No addditional configuration is required. It is also possible
to create dependencies on these tasks i.e.e

[source,groovy]
----
clean.dependsOn 'makeClean'
----

If another `GnuMakeBuild` task were created i.e. `runMake` then the task for the above
would simply be `runMakeClean`.

In v1.0 tasks created via rules do not have up to date checks in the same way that a
`GnuMakeBuild` tasks have as described earlier. If this is needed they will need to be
manually added via `inputs` and `outputs`. it is possible that support will be added in
a future release if the community requests it.
